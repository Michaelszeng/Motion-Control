An FTC project using [Road Runner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner). **Note:** Road Runner is in alpha and many of its APIs are incubating.

Due to limited access to physical robot (drive train), a basic drive train simulator is implemented.

## Installation

For more detailed instructions on getting Road Runner setup in your own project, see the [Road Runner README](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner#core).

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/FTCclueless/robotDriver`.

1. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

1. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in `build.common.gradle`.
