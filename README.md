An FTC project using [Road Runner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner). **Note:** Road Runner is in alpha and many of its APIs are incubating.

## Overview

Due to limited access to physical robot (drive train), a basic drive train simulator is implemented to facilitate the training and development without access of physical robot.

The simulator provides virtual drive train, virtual motors and virtual localizer. 


## Installation

For more detailed instructions on getting Road Runner setup in your own project, see the [Road Runner README](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner#core).

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/FTCclueless/robotDriver`.

2. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

3. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in`build.common.gradle`.
